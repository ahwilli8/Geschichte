So there I was, sitting in the Flughafen.
The Klimaanlage was broken and I was sweating bullets.
Not to mention the Musik in the terminal was driving me crazy.
Rammstein is just not a band I can get into.
I had to get to Berlin by morning, and there was only one option left, but I wasn't sure I liked it.
I hate BMW's, but it was the only car available.  
I stopped by the Baeckerei on my way.  
I needed my favorite Gebaeck to calm my nerves.  
Riding a sugar high, I pulled onto the Autobahn, but this car was a Hund - I was doing 100 in the slow lane, and I knew I'd have to find another gear.  
Even at my rate of speed I was still going to be late, I should have gotten a Porsche.
I finally reached the exit, and I merged onto the Hauptstrasse.
The Schloss was just a few more blocks down the road.
Hopefully I didn't miss the most delicious Bratwurst in the country.
