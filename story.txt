So there I was, sitting in the Flughafen.
The Klimaanlage was broken and I was sweating bullets.
Not to mention the Musik in the terminal was driving me crazy.
Rammstein is just not a band I can get into.
I had to get to Berlin by morning, and there was only one option left, but I wasn't sure I liked it.
I hate BMW's, but it was the only car available.  
I stopped by the Baeckerei on my way.  
I needed my favorite Gebaeck to calm my nerves.
